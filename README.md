# AI-ggregate: Web Service for Aggregating AI-Generated Content

This repository contains the diploma project for the bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute". The goal of the project is to develop a web service for aggregating AI-generated content, primarily focusing on AI-generated images. The system facilitates the search, recognition, and aggregation of such content from both open sources and user contributions.

## About the Project
The **AI-ggregate** web service is developed to address the growing need for a centralized service to handle AI-generated content. The platform aggregates AI-generated images from open sources, allows users to upload their own AI-generated content, and enables users to search and classify AI-generated images. It is particularly useful for developers, researchers in AI, and general users interested in generative AI content.

The main objectives of the project include:
- Simplifying the process of searching for and recognizing AI-generated images.
- Aggregating AI-generated content from open sources and user uploads.
- Providing a service for the classification of AI-generated images.

## Features
- **User authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **AI-generated image search**: Search aggregated AI-generated images from open sources.
- **Content aggregation**: Automatically aggregate AI-generated images from multiple open sources.
- **User uploads**: Allow users to upload their own AI-generated images for classification and storage.
- **AI-generated image recognition**: Classify images to determine if they were generated by AI.
- **Admin moderation**: Admins can manage and moderate aggregated content.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Python
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: NestJS, Flask
- **AI Library**: FastAI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **AI Models**: ResNet (for image classification)
